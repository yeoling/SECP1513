   The EY Technology Consultant talk was quite enlightening, focusing on the roles of technical and functional consultants in solving organizational challenges. It also emphasized the importance of a positive 
   attitude, teamwork, and adaptability, even for those without programming experience.
   It was very inspiring to learn how EY is into digital transformation and global collaboration, and how Malaysians have the opportunity to work with professionals from other countries. This session motivated me 
   to consider technology consulting as a career that aligns with my passion for innovation and problem-solving.

2. Assignment 2 : Industry Visit 1

   Some of the valuable experiences that I gained and the unforgettable memories from the industrial visit to UTM Digital were immense. It opened my eyes on various aspects. During the visit, I had the opportunity 
   to learn how UTM Digital works and how all employees interact with each other. I was impressed because every employee working in UTM Digital shares one goal, which is to make university life easier for the 
   students who come to study here at UTM. They have done many apps and services to make life easier on campus, which made the student's life smoother and more interactive. This visit not only broadened my 
   understanding of digital innovation but also inspired me to create solutions that can make a difference in the lives of citizens.

   The talk by Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah highlighted the importance of mastering technical skills like programming, system analysis, and emerging technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and big data. It also 
   emphasized soft skills like teamwork, communication, and adaptability for long-term success. This session inspired me to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry demands by staying updated with 
   trends, working on projects, and continuously improving both technical and interpersonal skills to thrive in the IT field.

4. Assignment 4: Industry Visit 2

   It was the industrial visit that changed my perspective and showed how technology advancement helps industries to change their face. The actual application of cloud computing, AI, and IoT in learning proved it 
   would make much difference in efficiency and innovation. Emphasis on industry-required skills, programming, cybersecurity, and project management showed me that more needs to be done in terms of enhancement of 
   both technical and interpersonal skills. This visit again underlined the capability to flex in the atmosphere of continuous change and further urged me with regard to learning and self-improvement in 
   technology.
