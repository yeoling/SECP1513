1. Assignment 1: Industry Talk 1 [Poster](https://github.com/yeoling/SECP1513/blob/main/Poster%20industry%20talk%201(Assignment%201).jpg)
   
  The EY Technology Consultant talk was quite enlightening, focusing on the roles of technical and functional consultants in solving organizational challenges. It also emphasized the importance of a positive 
  attitude, teamwork, and adaptability, even for those without programming experience.
  It was very inspiring to learn how EY is into digital transformation and global collaboration, and how Malaysians have the opportunity to work with professionals from other countries. This session motivated me to 
  consider technology consulting as a career that aligns with my passion for innovation and problem-solving.
